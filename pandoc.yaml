# -- PDF layout (LaTeX) -------------------------------------------------------
# These map to Pandoc's LaTeX template variables and are passed directly to
# the PDF engine. Pandoc reads them natively from this file — no scripts or
# environment variables needed.
#
# Reference: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex

# Paper size for LaTeX (PDF only)
#
# This corresponds to LaTeX's `papersize` option (no "paper" suffix).
#
# Common values:
# - letter     (8.5" x 11", US)
# - a4         (210mm x 297mm, international standard)
# - a5         (148mm x 210mm, compact book size)
# - b5         (176mm x 250mm, used in publishing)
#
papersize: letter

# Page geometry (margins) for LaTeX
#
# Use LaTeX geometry syntax: margin=1in or top=20mm, bottom=25mm, etc.
#
# Reference: https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry
#
# Common values:
# - margin=1in                                    (default, good for general documents)
# - top=20mm, bottom=25mm, left=20mm, right=20mm  (compact, use with a5)
# - inner=30mm, outer=20mm, top=25mm, bottom=25mm (wider inner margin for binding)
# - margin=10mm                                   (minimal margin — may clip when printed)
#
geometry: margin=1in

# Base font size for LaTeX document
#
# Accepted values: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt
# Default: 11pt
#
fontsize: 11pt

# Font family for the main body text (requires XeLaTeX engine)
#
# The Keystone font registry generates \setmainfont from this value.
# Libertine is the default. Comment out to fall back to Latin Modern.
#
# Supported values:
#   - libertine      (Linux Libertine — serif, with Biolinum as sans companion)
#   - dejavu-serif   (DejaVu Serif)
#   - dejavu-sans    (DejaVu Sans)
#   - dejavu-mono    (DejaVu Sans Mono)
#   - latin-modern   (Latin Modern Roman — the TeX default)
#
# Any other value is passed through to the Pandoc template as
# \usepackage{<value>} — use this for custom LaTeX font packages.
#
fontfamily: libertine

# -- EPUB options --------------------------------------------------------------

# The cover image for your book (EPUB only)
#
# Path to the cover image file relative to the project root.
# It should be a valid image format (e.g., PNG, JPG).
#
# This maps to Pandoc's `cover-image` metadata field and is used only
# when building EPUB output. Leaving it empty is safe — the Keystone
# Lua filter strips empty values so EPUB builds proceed without a cover.
#
# Example: ./assets/cover.jpg
#
cover-image:
